%The stability analysis using bilinear transformation,
%we first substitute z = (w+1)/(w-1) in the characteristics equation P(z) = 0 
%and simplify it to get the characteristic equation in w -plane as Q(w) = 0. 
%Once the characteristics equation is transformed as Q(w) = 0, 
%Routh stability criterion is directly used in the same manner as in a continuous time system. 

%P(z) = z³ + a2*z² + a1*z + a0 = 0
%z = (w+1)/(w-1);
%Q(w) = (1+a2+a1+a0)w³ + (3 + a2 - a1-3a0)w² + (3-a2-a1+3a0)w + (1-a2+a1-a0)
